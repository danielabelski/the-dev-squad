# Changelog

All notable changes to **The Dev Squad** are documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses [SemVer](https://semver.org/) loosely while pre-`v1.0`.

## [v0.4.2] — 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- **Office wander overlap.** Agents could land on top of each other in the office scene because the wander avoidance only considered other workers' *idle* positions — it ignored workers at home or at a phase override. Surfaced when Eddie was added in v0.4.1: his couch home (1080, 485) coincided exactly with a couch idle spot, so wanderers could walk right onto him. New `computeOccupiedPositions` helper now considers every other worker's actual current position (`phase override > idle > home`). New `isCandidateBlocked` helper preserves the existing group-spot exception (couch / hookah / pingpong allow same-label stacking) but blocks exact-coord collisions unconditionally. Both wander loops in `LunarOfficeScene.tsx` now use the helpers.
- **TypeScript error baseline cleared.** All 10 pre-existing `tsc --noEmit` errors fixed:
  - 6 × TS5097 (`.ts` import extension): added `"allowImportingTsExtensions": true` to `tsconfig.json` (one-line fix).
  - 2 × TS2322 (`securityMode` widening in `orchestrator.ts`): annotated the `let` declaration as `'fast' | 'strict'`.
  - 1 × TS2345 (Docker child `stdin: null` in `runner.ts`): cast `child as unknown as RunnerChild` with a comment explaining nothing on the docker path reads stdin.
  - 1 × TS2345 (`'pingpong'` not in `sendGroup` signature in `LunarOfficeScene.tsx`): widened the parameter type to include `'pingpong'`.
  - `tsc --noEmit` now exits with zero errors.

### Removed

- **Dead code in `LunarOfficeScene.tsx`:**
  - `pickIdlePositions` function (deterministic seed-based wander picker that lost to the timer-based wander system that ships today).
  - `gatherSpots` array (planned cluster spots that lost to the `idleSpots` label-based group system that ships today).
  - Both were defined and never called. Deletion is safe — no compile or runtime change.

### Notes

- All four test files still pass (`pipeline-runtime`, `supervisor-snapshot`, `hook-contract`, `audit-findings`).
- No version-controlled behavior or API change beyond the overlap fix.

## [v0.4.1] — 2026-04-19

### Added

- **Agent E in the office scene.** Eddie (white pirate sprite) now appears in the Lunar Office View whenever the Security Audit toggle is on at build start. He chills on the couch by the TV when not auditing, takes Agent A's seat at the planner desk during the `security-audit` phase, then heads back to the couch when the audit is done. Sprite generated from the gray base (`agent_b`) by recoloring to a white-tone palette. CC0 source pack: Foozle Scallywag Pirates.
- New optional `runFinalAudit` prop on `LunarOfficeScene`. When `false` (default) the office renders identically to pre-`v0.4.0`.

### Changed

- `WorkerId` union now includes `'auditor'`. All `Record<WorkerId, ...>` declarations updated to satisfy the type. Wander loops gate the `'auditor'` worker on `runFinalAudit`.

### Fixed

- `agentSpeech('E')` now flows from `page.tsx` into the office scene's speech bubbles instead of the previous hardcoded `null`.

### Notes

- No pipeline, API, or agent-behavior changes. Pure office-scene polish on top of `v0.4.0`.
- Known cleanup deferred: `pickIdlePositions` and `gatherSpots` in `LunarOfficeScene.tsx` are defined but never called. Will be swept out in a follow-up.

## [v0.4.0] — 2026-04-18

### Added

- **Optional Security Audit (Agent E)** — read-only OWASP-class audit phase that runs after the tester reports tests passing, only when the user toggles "Security Audit" on at build start. Severity-ranked findings (`critical`/`high`/`medium`/`low`) calibrated by exploitability and prerequisites.
- Pause-and-decide flow: new `pipelineStatus = 'awaiting-audit-decision'` after E's verdict. The orchestrator exits cleanly. User actions (Send to C / Dismiss / Deploy) respawn the orchestrator via the same pattern as `resumePipelineRun`.
- Per-finding scoped fix loop (user-initiated only): "Send to C" runs C with a focused fix-only-this prompt, D verifies the existing tests still pass, then E re-audits only that finding. Status flows through `Open → Sent to C → Re-auditing → Resolved` or `Still Open`. **No automatic loops.**
- Dedicated **Security Audit panel** in the Office View with findings list, chat with E, and a gated `Deploy now` button with confirmation modal. A/B/C/D panels squish to make room while S stays full size; layout reverts when audit isn't active.
- New `POST /api/audit-action` endpoint enforces a serialization gate (`auditActionInFlight`) and validates state preconditions.
- `pipeline/role-e.md`, `src/components/agents/SecurityAuditPanel.tsx`, `src/app/api/audit-action/route.ts`, `scripts/test-audit-findings.mjs`.

### Deprecated

- **Sandboxed/isolated execution is no longer an active roadmap item.** The runner abstraction (`pipeline/runner.ts`) and `DockerRunner` code remain in the tree for narrow cases, but Claude Code subscription auth inside containers is too unreliable to make sandboxed execution a default. If you need OS-level isolation today, run The Dev Squad inside a VM you own.

### Removed

- `SANDBOX-RUNNER-PLAN.md`, `SUPERVISOR-BUILD-PLAN.md`, `UI-AND-HEADLESS-PLAN.md`.

### Docs

- README rewritten with the v0.4.0 hacker aesthetic: phosphor capsule banner, animated typing taglines, ASCII squad roster, mermaid pipeline diagram, terminal-prompt footer. Six-agent team, new badges, updated Controls reference.
- ARCHITECTURE.md, SECURITY.md, SECURITY-ROADMAP.md updated to add E and remove the sandbox promise. SECURITY-ROADMAP repositions E as the near-term safety layer; v0.5 (host-owned policy) is the next planned phase, no ship date.
- TODO.md cleaned of dead Docker hardening items.
- `pipeline/checklist-template.md` rewrote Phase 4b for the new user-controlled review/fix-loop/deploy flow.
- All role files updated (`role-c`, `role-d`, `role-s` mention the optional audit; `role-e` covers chat, severity ranking, re-audit modes).
- `feat: boundary-thinking review methodology for B/D/E` (`63d7bb9`) — added a structured analysis lens to the three review agents based on patterns from the `mattmillartech` fork's `/api/review` endpoint.

### Tests

- Hook contract: 10 new E permission checks (read allowed; write/edit/bash/web/agent denied). 35 checks total.
- Pipeline runtime: E auto-resumes for `security-audit` phase; new resume prompt asserted.
- Supervisor snapshot: 4 new scenarios (audit running, awaiting-decision with findings, action-in-flight, clean-audit awaiting deploy).
- `scripts/test-audit-findings.mjs` validates `AUDIT_SCHEMA` shape and `AuditFinding` state-machine transitions.
